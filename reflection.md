The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that allows the user to view different ASCII art images. I did 
this by making each ASCII art image its own function, making a function to choose some of them at random, and a function to 
serve as a menu that lets the user choose whether to view a circle, make their own lines, or view a random image. This 
assignment posed a unique problem, and that was the barrier of my own creativity. I struggled to make the ASCII art more 
than anything else. The "\\" character served as an issue because I could not figure out how to implement it into the 
images without getting some sort of error. Ultimately, I was able to make the code functional. It was difficult to do 
the creative part of this assignment, but it was not a deal breaker.
